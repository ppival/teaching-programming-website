<h2 id="what-are-personas">What are personas?</h2>

<p>Personas are imaginary users for a project. By articulating their background, the problem they face, and how your project is going to help them, personas provide a way to determine the scope of your project, identify use cases, and essential features. The Carpentries use <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-lesson-study/index.html#learner-profiles">this approach</a> when designing new lessons.</p>

<h2 id="the-personas">The personas</h2>

<h3 id="the-lesson-creators">The lesson creators</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Robin</em> is a graduate student in neurosciences and has developed a Python
library for image analysis. They want to create a tutorial for this library
that they will teach to other students and postdocs at an international
conference. Robin wants to make this tutorial and the notes for this workshop
available online, but they don&rsquo;t have time to create a template that looks
good.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Stacey</em> has been using R for 10+ years and teaches a semester-long course in
statistics (using R) to graduate students in social sciences. She uses a
flipped-classroom setting: the students go through the lecture notes and
short-exercises (formative assessments) outside of class. They come to class
to ask questions and work on problems that integrate the skills taught in the
lessons.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-lesson-contributors">The lesson contributors</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Sam</em> enjoyed attending Robin&rsquo;s workshop. He is a postdoc who published a
paper that used Robin&rsquo;s Python library. He would like to contribute to Robin&rsquo;s
tutorial by adding some tips on how to get started based on his own experience
with this library. He knows how to create a pull request on GitHub, and uses
markdown regularly to type his ideas, and notes.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Rosa</em> is a teaching assistant for Stacey&rsquo;s class. One of her responsibilities
is to propose updates on the lectures and exercises students go through on
their own based on the questions they ask in class. She has been using R for
just over a year. Stacey values her perspective to make the lecture notes more
approachable to beginners. She&rsquo;s just learned how to submit pull requests.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-lessons-adapters-and-the-teachers">The lessons adapters and the teachers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Pinja</em> found Robin&rsquo;s tutorial online started using this library for her work.
She will teach the tutorial to people in her lab, but wants to switch the
dataset to something more relevant to their research. Robin has integrated
extensive notes in the tutorial that will be helpful for Pinja to prepare. She
wants to see the notes as she&rsquo;s teaching but she thinks they will be too
distracting for people attending the workshop to see.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Norma</em>, who is starting as a new professor at the same university as Stacey,
wants to use a flipped-classroom approach to the statistics class she will be
teaching to biologists. Stacey encourages her to use her lesson as a starting
point. Norma finds that adapting the lessons for her own needs saved her a lot
of time, and allowed her to provide feedback on the pedagogical approach taken
by Stacey.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-learners">The learners</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Sofie</em> is attending Robin&rsquo;s workshop and has just started grad school. She
has taken a few Python tutorials online. She wants to make sure that she will
be able to reproduce the analyses demonstrated during the workshop on her own,
and use the dataset provided in the workshop to learn other data manipulation
and visualization skills, as she hasn&rsquo;t generated her own data yet.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Ayoub</em> has discovered the website for Stacey&rsquo;s class as he was looking up how
to perform an ANCOVA in R for his senior thesis in social sciences. He found
that this website contained information that complemented the general
statistics course he took the previous year. The learning objectives at the
beginning of each lesson, the regular exercises to check that he is
understanding each concept, and the summary of the keypoints covered in the
lesson, are improving his understanding of the connections among the different
concepts. The glossary also helps him to understand the technical found in the
lesson.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-personas-telling-us">What are the personas telling us?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Background: (R)markdown, Git/GitHub</li>
<li>language agnostic (R or Python)</li>
<li>solutions to exercises should be hidden</li>
<li>the packages and other system requirements needed to reproduce the code
included in the lessons (and the exercises) need to be made clear to the
learners</li>
<li>the organization of the files in the repository should be obvious</li>
<li>learner/teacher view for the lessons</li>
<li>glossary</li>
<li>easy to retrieve datasets used in the lesson</li>
</ul>
